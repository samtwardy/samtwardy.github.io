		<h1>Breadcrumbs Mag</h1>
		<p>Breadcrumbs Mag is an exercise in motivation and shared inspiration, a chance to create when otherwise your professional life might not give you reason to, an outlet to plant the seeds of an idea and watch where they can go, through your own mind or someone else's.</p>
